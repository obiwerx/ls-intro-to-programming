5)  Both snippets will return 3.  In the first snippet,
you have 1 being added to 0, and return the new value,
which is now 1. Three loops of this ends with x being 3.
In the second snippet, you set y to 1, then set x to y,
which means it has the same value at that moment in
time, so x is 1 as is y. Each loop sets the values equal
to one another, since the previous value of x is overwritten
by y's new incremented value.

6) The error message is telling the programmer that he used
and undeclared variable in the local scope.

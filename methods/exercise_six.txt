ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

Error is saying you only passed one argument to the
calculate_product method when it was expecting two.
You should consider passing default arguments to avoid
this situation.
